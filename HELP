Fileformat: The editor reads plain text files and RTF-files. Other files
might also possibly open ;) Use the file menu, press open file, and choose
the desired file to open it in the viewer.

The editor hightlights certain search terms as defined by the user. If the
window showing the search terms are not visible, choose Search Terms from
the View menu.

Search terms are saved as a user setting when you quit the editor. If
running several instances be sure to keep the instance with the terms you
would like too keep for a new session until the other program instances are
closed. The search terms will then be overwritten with the desired search
terms when you quit your last program instance.

Usually you can express search terms directly, however more complex terms
can be defined as the search terms are interpreted as regular expressions.
See the introduction section on http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qregexp.html for
more info.
